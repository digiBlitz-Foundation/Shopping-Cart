YesCart is an e-commerce platform build using java technology.

The platform is designed as multi store (and multi tenancy) e-commerce server allowing multiple businesses and/or multiple business brands to create and manage their online stores with ease. However clients requiring simple one store servers will enjoy the platform as well without entering configuration nightmare - it is all very simple and takes just a few clicks in the administration application (known as JAM).

Storefront server includes all e-commerce basics as well as taking some of the most important features further. Such as multichannel capabilities through themes that adapt to customer devices; superior search and navigation capabilities to make sure your customers not only find products but find the right ones; and full e-commerce order lifecycle encapsulated within the platform as event system giving a clear and robust order processing.

JAM server puts business users in control of the platform (but only to the parts they have access to defined by assigned roles). All data is fully manageable through user friendly editors and can be imported via built in import wizard in the form of comma separated value files (CSV) or a zip archive with multiple CSV. Additionally JAM includes call center section that allows customer order management.

So it is all easily configurable but that is not all! Every business is unique requiring specific functionality, which is why YesCart was build for easy extension. Third party systems intergration is very simple through web services and storefront REST API.

And that is still not all! YesCart is an embodiment of e-commerce best practices and a true test driven design (TDD) platform to ensure all code is functional, efficacious and works with staggering performance.
